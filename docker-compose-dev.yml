# The purpose of docker compose is to make it easier to run and build multiple
# containers as well as provide arguments to each one that it needs to run and
# communicate with the other images.
#
# This file accomplishes the following:
#
# 1. Ensure Express and React are mapped to listen on certain ports
# 2. Provide env variables 
# 3. Allow communication between images/containers.
#
# Keep in mind that this is a DEVELOPMENT environment. This file is made to set up 
# an efficient workflow by using volumes and bookmarks. It attempts to minimize
# rebuilds.
